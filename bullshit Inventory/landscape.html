			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<div class="stair">
				<img class="eventImg" src="trash.jpg">
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I watched "Manufactured Landscape" documentary on one of my classes. This
					film gives close picture of how the world largest factory worked in China
					in 2004. It emphsizes on the large scale and heavy workload of those factory workers.
 					Then, the film suddently
					starts to show some very miserable views of environmental distructions all over the world. Then, the film turns
					back to trash and wastes thrown into the rivers by a Chinese factory again.
					And it further explains many countries export raw material to China to have Chinese
					factories manufactured them and exported the finished manufacture goods oversee again.
					The whole film is filled with sentimental music.

			<h2>Argument</h2>
			<div class="stair">
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The film seems like to say that the world's environmental destructions
					were caused by China because it shows the images of the Chinese factories and then
					environmental destructions over the the world. My confusion about this
					is why the factories in China cause the pollution and demages in other part of
					the world directly. This <strong>mutates the fact by using unfair comparisons</strong>. It makes
					more sense if the film producer depicts pollutions in other parts of the world too, not
					just targeting China.

					Also for me, this <strong>only tells the part of the story</strong>.
					The other part of the story is that China, as a fast developing country in
					2004, was the world largest manufacturing land, receiving imports of
					wastes and scraps from many developed countries.
					Then, China manufactured goods out of those usable wastes and then
					exported them back. How about those wastes that are not usable. China has to
					figure out herself.
					Notice here, <strong>China
					did not produce those wastes but was the just recipient of those wastes.
					Unfortuately, China could not ship those unusable wastes back to where
					they belong to.</strong> Furthermore, isn't this how globalization works?
					<strong>Were China not to receive those wastes, would the environment
						and other developed countries be better off?</strong>
					The answer might not be so. I just read an article from Wall Street Journal
					the other day talking about U.S. had to spend extra cost to rent 60,000
					square feet warehourses to put waste paper scraps, which were supposed to export
					to China, because China just made strict rules of limiting importing wastes.
					Now, U.S. tries to figure out how to deal with that gigantic amount of
					paper scraps. (You can read the full story <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-is-no-1-in-exporting-trashwhat-if-no-one-wants-it-anymore-1507483011">here</a>)

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This film makes the statement that only tell the
					partial story and mutate the fact. Furthermore, the documentory is facing to
					the public with educational purpose. Thus, the magnitude of Bullshit should be 4. The
					intention of this BS may be good, despite of targeting at China,
					because it warns people all over the world to protect environment.
