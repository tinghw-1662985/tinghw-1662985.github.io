				<h1>Of Course "Win Share" is More Accurate</h1>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<div class="floor">
				<p class="note">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did project for one of my classes last quarter
						talking about a basketball statistics called "win share" which can tell
						a player's contribution to team success. Because people focus
						too much on offensive basketball stats, such as how many points a player can
						get, but ignoring lots of defensive players' contribution to team success due
						to the fact that defenses are hard to be recorded in numbers explicitly, I
						decided to use the concept of "win share" to measure NBA players more fairly. But
						how do you prove "win share" measurement is good?
						Then, I collected every player's salary as the 2nd measurement of their value,
						and compared the two. Surprisingly, I found a correlation between the two. That
						being said, if the salary, more or less, determines a player's value, "win share"
						does too. That is how I proved "win share" is the good measurement.
						Furthermore, I made the conclusion that "win share is more
						accurate than salary to measure a player’s overall game performance due to
						the higher R-Square value (denser) when comparing to some of the major stats".

			<h2>Argument</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The key is how is "Win Share" calculated.
					In short, it is calculated by using both offensive statistics and
					defensive statistics with complex math. (You can see the full explaination
					<a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">here</a>).
					In other words, somebody calculated
					a number to represent a NBA player's contribution to team wins by using other
					game statistics. If that is the case, of couse win share has stronger correlation
					to other major stats than salary does because they come from those stats.
					This is where bullshit should be called. I used <strong>confirmation bias</strong>.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is bullshit because the statement does
					not explictly say "win share" comes from those major basketball statistics,
					so it should belong to "tell partial story". The intention should be positive
					because I wanted to raise the audience's attention to defensive player'
					s contribution too. The statement is to public. The magnitude is 2.
