				<h1>Miracle in Venezuela?</h1>
			<div class="source">
				<p>Date: 10-12-2017</p>
				<p>Source: Macroeconomics Class; BS I exposed to</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					The South American nation of Venezuela has had one of the
					world’s fastest-growing nominal GDPs since 1997. Between 1997 and 2007,
					Venezuelan nominal GDP grew by an average of 28% each year. The growth
					rate is much faster than nominal GDP in the United States or even
					in booming economies like China. So, Venezuela must be experiencing
					an economic miracle.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Argument</h2>
			<div class="floor">
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to determine if Venezuela's economics is growing at a such fast speed,
					we need to first figure out what "normal GDP" means and how it is different
					from real GDP. Nominal GDP is measured using today's aggregate price level times
					 the output in any given year. Real GDP is measured by calculating price times output quantity,
					 assuming prices somehow stayed “constant” at a base year’s prices. In short,
					 real GDP uses constant prices when calculating GDP so as to eliminate the
					 inflation factor, while "norminal GDP" does not factor out price inflation.
					 See the graph(from Econ 201 slide) on the left, Venezuela did not experience
					 a fast economic growth, but suffered from a unusually high inflation. <br/>

					 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This claim should be doubted because it seems too good to be true. It falls
					 into "tell partial story" and "mutate the fact" categories because the producer
					 did not mention about "Real GDP" and mutated the fact of Venezuela's economics
 				 	 growth. However, whether the producer deliberately hid the other part of the
					 story or was just ignorant of the truth is hard to tell. Thus, this claim
					 does not meet "lie about one's belief" or "careless about the truth".

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The intention of this claim is unclear due to unknown context of the claim
					 producer. This claim is to the public and meets two criteria, so the
					 magnitude is 3.
