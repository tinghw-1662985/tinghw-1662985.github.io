			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<div class="stair">
				<p class="note">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On last Saturday, I played basketbll in IMA. I played one-on-one with
						a dude. I beat him twice and I kind of noticed he was not very happy
						about it. In order to make him feel better, I told him "sorry bro, I
						am just lucky today. I do not usually shoot this well." He, then, laughed
						and seemed feel better (lol). But did I really just make
						those shots by luck? Not really. I thought I shot like my average level.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Argument</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clearly, I lied of my belief for good reason. But did I mutate the
						fact or was I careless about truth? Neither. I believed that I performed
						my average level, but the fact may or may not be that
						I did shoot better than my average level. It is just hard to tell
						if my belief equals to the fact. Therefore, I did not mutate the fact
						because I did not know about the fact. Furthermore, it is not that
						I did not care about the truth. Rather, I just lied so to not make my opponent
						feel bad.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I lied of my belief for good intention, so the magnitude of this statement is 1
					and the intention of the statement is positve.
