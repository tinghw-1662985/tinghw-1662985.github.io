			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<div class="stair">
				<img class="eventImg" src="interview.jpg" alt="interview">
				<p class="note">
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A title "I interview 100,000 people a year, and there are 6 questions that make job candidates stick in my mind"
						came into my sight when I was checking my Facebook the other day.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Argument</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I thought of the title for a minute and
					confirmed that this is bullshit because it does not care about the truth and
					and mutates the fact. It is a simple calculation: assuming he works
					12 hours everyday without taking a single holiday, he has to interview
					23 candidates for 365 days! Obviously, this cannot be fact.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is bullshit because the statement does not care about the truth
					and mutates the fact. It is to the public, so the magnitude of BS is 3 when everything added up.
					However, I would say the intention is good because
					the article wants to give job candidates some advice.
