		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<div class="stair">
			<img class="eventImg" src="JL_dreads.jpg">
			<p class="note">
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In an Instagram video that now appears to have been deleted, Martin, a
				former member of the New Jersey Nets, addressed Lin's dreadlocks, saying,
				"Do I need to remind this damn boy that his last name Lin?" Martin
				continued, saying: "Come on, man, somebody need to tell him, like,
				<strong>'All right, bro, we get it. You wanna be black.'</strong>"
<br/>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lin responded on Instagram (in a tweet that also seems to have been deleted),
				saying he was appreciative of Martin even commenting on it (via ESPN):
				"Hey man, it's all good. You definitely don't have to like my hair and
				[are] definitely entitled to your opinion. Actually I [am] legit grateful
				[for] you sharin it [to be honest]. At the end of the day, I appreciate
				that I have dreads and you have Chinese tattoos [because] I think its a
				sign of respect. And I think as minorities, the more that we appreciate
				each other's cultures, the more we influence mainstream society. Thanks
				for everything you did for the Nets and hoops ... had your poster up on
				my wall growin up."

		<h2>Argument</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="note">
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here comes question, "did Jeremy Lin change his hair style because he
					wants to be black?" Obviously,
					Kenyon Martin thought so. He believes Jeremy Lin has dreads because he wants
					to become black due to the fact that dreads is a common hair style among
					black communities. Thus, Martin did not lie about his belief.
					Martin also cares about the truth because he would not critisize J-Lin
					unless he cares about it. However,
					his belief might not be the fact. Per Jeremy's response, he thinks it
					is a sign of respect and appreciation of other minority cultures.
					Furthermore, Jeremy wrote a long article about his hair afterwards
					<a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/jeremy-lin-brooklyn-nets-about-my-hair/">(view)</a>.
					In addtion, Jeremy Lin has started to change his hair styles very
					frequently since 2 years ago. He might just wants to try some dreads
					this time.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="note">
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Martin mutated the fact that J-Lin having dreads was not for being looked
				like black. It meets one criterion and is to the public, so the magnitude is 2. For whatever
				reason, I personally do not think the intention of this statement is positive.
